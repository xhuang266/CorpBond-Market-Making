# Automated Corporate Bond Market Making via Stochastic Optimal Control + Full-Stack Dashboard

This project implements an **Event-Driven RFQ (Request for Quote) Quoting Engine** specifically designed for the US Corporate Bond market. The system leverages the **Guéant-Lehalle-Tapia (2013)** framework to provide liquidity while dynamically managing inventory risk in a fragmented, illiquid environment. The system is deployed as a **full-stack application** featuring a **Flask REST API** backend and a **React-based Trader Dashboard**.

## Key Features

Beyond the theoretical framework, this engine incorporates several "production-grade" enhancements to handle real-world trading constraints:

* **Dynamic Inventory Skewing:** Implements the closed-form solution for stochastic optimal control to calculate the optimal price deviation based on current position and risk aversion.
* **Microstructure-Adjusted Pricing:**
    * **Square-Root Impact Law:** Quantifies the liquidity premium required for large block trades relative to Average Daily Volume.
    * **Logistic Execution Model:** Calibrates fill probability based on spread width and order size to prevent "quoting out of the market."
* **Robust Safety Valves:**
    * **Inventory Dampening:** Prevents "Panic Pricing" by clipping extreme inventory inputs, ensuring the model stays competitive even during high exposure.
    * **Volatility-Linked Stop-Loss:** Implements a dynamic "Maximum Give-up" floor based on real-time volatility to protect the book during regime shifts.
* **Backend (Python/Flask):** Exposes the quantitative model via RESTful API endpoints. Handles numerical optimization and data processing.
* **Frontend (React + Tailwind):** A high-performance, dark-mode trading dashboard that features:
    * Real-time RFQ simulation.
    * Interactive parameter tuning (Gamma, Intensity, Decay).
    * Visualizations for fill probability and spread decomposition.
